gtkradiant (1.6.6-0wjd1+ubu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  * Update patch files. Fix warnings in bspc code.
  * Add patch to NOT rename *.map symlinks, but overwriting their contents.
    Useful when you're working on a symlink to a map file from a
    single-map-file repository.
  * Add patch to NOT load brush faces in reverse order. This patch also
    dictionary sorts the entities dictionary. This fix makes saved .map files
    contain fewer "changes".
  * Document that entities.def are not loaded from the "entitypath".
  * Add "radiant.mo" in /usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES for initial language
    support.

  * Generated tar.gz should be reproducible now.
